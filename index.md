## Objective
Design and construct a mechincal system using National Instruments hardware 
[LabVIEW](www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html) software. 

System's design is constrained to have at least three stages, fit within a 
10"x10"x22" space, and contain at least seven of the modules listed below:
* LCD Screen
* DC Motor with Encoder
* Stepper Motor
* Micro Servos
* IR Distance Sensor
* Buttons
* LEDs
* Seven Segment Display
* Piezo Buzzer
* Limit Switch

## Materials
* 6 sheets commulatively of
	+ Plywood (12"x24"x 1/8" or 1/4 ")
	+ Acylic (12"x24"x 1/8" or 1/4 ")
* Threaded rods (22"x 3/8")
* Smooth rods (22"x 1/4")
* Pulleys (1" diameter)
* Twine/Nylon string
* 1.75mm filament for 3D printer
* And anything you request or buy on your own


## Key highlights

1.There are two axis of rotation. One to make the horses turn horizontally and
the other to move the horses up and down. We 3D printed a bevel to allow for the
horses to move up and down. There is a centeral bevel gear and 4 other bevel
gears attached to each section. When the horses would rotate the outer bevel
gears would rotate when the central bevel gear would rotate the opposite
direction. This was a challenge for us because we thought we could control both
axis of rotation within the lower module. That didn't work because the wires for
the motors would just get tangled up. We then thought of using a slip ring to
allow for the wires to rotate but no matter how we configured it, it would not
work. Once we moved one of the motors to the upper module we had a challenge
getting bevel gears to align correctly. Once we added weights to the top, to
help hold down the central bevel gear we were able to make the horses gallop. 

2. The upper module contains two long strips of wood cut in a configuration to
allow it to bend. This is called a living hinge pattern and by making multiple
cuts the wood adopted the bending characteristics. 

3. We allowed for 3 separate stages for both axis of rotation providing us with
9 different configurations.
